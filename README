Almanna ORM
-----------

REQUIREMENTS

Almanna is written in the Vala programming language, and relies on other
libraries for its functionality. To build, you will need:

* Vala 0.16.0 or higher
* CMake 2.8 or higher
* The GCC 4.x toolchain

At minimum, the following libraries are required:

* glib-2.0
* gio-2.0
* gee-1.0
* libgda-5.0
* libxml-2.0

OPTIONS

BUILDING/INSTALLING FROM GIT

Almanna uses CMake to configure and prepare the source for installation. By
default, Almanna will install into /usr. To build the framework using an "out
of source" build:

* Verify cmake is installed on your machine
* Create a directory called "build", and cd into that directory
* Enter "cmake .." without the quotes to prepare the build
* Enter "make" without the quotes to build Almanna
* Enter "make install" as root or under sudo to install Almanna

If you would like to install into another prefix, use the -D option to provide
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH to cmake. For example, to install to /usr/local:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ..

Note that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must allow for libraries in /usr/local.
